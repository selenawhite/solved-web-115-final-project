It is time to put your knowledge of JavaScript to work. Youâ€&#x2122;re going to build something useful that you may even use beyond the scope of this course. Your WEB 115 JavaScript Project requires you to create a personal resume building tool. Form elements will be used to accept user input which will be assigned to variables. These variable values will make up the content of a new Web page that will be generated when a form button named Create Resume is clicked. This is called building a Web page “on-the-fly”. I understand that you have not turned in any assignments that are identical to this during the course of the semester. That is precisely the point. You are now required to think outside of the box. That is why I’m allowing extra time for you to complete this work. I’m not throwing you to the wolves. I’ve provided you with an example of how to create a web page on the fly. You can find this invaluable example by scrolling to the bottom of this page.

1. Create an HTML document named finalProject. The title bar (tab) should read WEB 115 Final Project.

2. Create an external JavaScript document (with the .js file extension) named projectJS.js. In projectJS.js, enter the code that will write your name with the following formatting: H1 header, red, Tahoma font, centered text. On a new line your JavaScript must write your course and section number with the following formatting: H2 header, Garamond font, red, italicized, centered text. All remaining JavaScript must be coded in this document.

3. In your HTML document named finalProject, write the Javascript code (after the opening BODY tag) that will link to your external JavaScript document named projectJS.js so that your name, course and section number appear in the finalProject.htm Web document.

4. Create a horizontal rule that is sixty percent of the width of the viewer’s screen in finalProject.htm

5. Create a centered title that reads Build Your Resume.

6. Use break and paragraph tags in order to make all of the following elements easy to read and understand.

7. Create a text box with the appropriate prompt (not the prompt method) so that the user knows to enter their full name.

8. Create a text box with the appropriate prompt (not the prompt method) so that the user knows to enter their full address.

9. Create a text box with the appropriate prompt (not the prompt method) so that the user knows to enter their phone number

10. Create a text box with the appropriate prompt (not the prompt method) so that the user knows to enter their e-mail address

11. Write JavaScript code to validate the e-mail address input. Make sure that the user has entered the @ symbol. No resume should be generated until this validation is completed.

12. Use the form textarea tag to create a text entry area with the appropriate prompt (not the prompt method) so that the user knows to enter their personal data.

13. Use the form textarea tag to create a text entry area with the appropriate prompt (not the prompt method) so that the user knows to enter their career objective.

14. Use the form textarea tag to create a text entry area with the appropriate prompt (not the prompt method) so that the user knows to enter their Educational background.

15. Create a text box with the appropriate prompt (not the prompt method) so that the user knows to enter the entry and exit dates of their most recent employment experience. IMPORTANT! For this item you must use the input “date” element. Example: &lt;input type = “date” id=”myDate1″ /&gt; which will generate a calendar when clicked. Use the value property to extract the user’s selection. Example: var firstDate = document.getElementById(“myDate1”).value

16. Use the form textarea tag to create a text entry area with the appropriate prompt (not the prompt method) so that the user knows to enter the details of their most recent employment experience.

17. Repeat steps 14 and 15 to allow for 3 more prior employment experience data entry areas.

18. Use the form textarea tag to create a text entry area with the appropriate prompt (not the prompt method) so that the user knows to enter the details of their business references.

19. Create a form button named Create Resume. When clicked this button should call a function that generates a new Web page displaying a resume based on the user input. Use the document.write() method to populate the newly generated Web page with all of the HTML elements, formatting and variable values needed to produce the desired output in Web (.htm) format.

HINT: a monospaced font will allow text wrapping in your output. You may also provide for this using CSS.

DeliverablesWhen your work is complete you must upload your Web and JavaScript file(s) to the Wake Tech wcet2.waketech.edu server. An account on this server has been created for you. You will need File Transfer Protocol (FTP) software. Please note the instructions below.

Finally, you must provide a working “clickable” link to your assignment page on the wcet2 server in this Chapter 9 Assignment submission area

Additional instructionsPlease note the output example displayed below. Items that do not require user input such as the Character Reference entry should be hard coded so that they appear in the generated resume without any user input.

You will need to create a two column layout in your generated resume Web page to achieve the desired layout. Use an HTML5/CSS based layout (i.e do not use HTML tables for formatting purposes).

This example is a print out. Your result will appear in a Web browser. The colored background is not a requirement.
